# callingapp sos

My first application

Hello my friends, I just invited you to participate on my android studio application

The purpose of the application is to:
  1. Make the SOS calls: "this part is already finished", since I used the Sinch SDK
  2. Trace the position of the person who just called by recovering his position with -> "here I use the MapBox API" is also finished
  at. latitude
  b. is the logitude

  My question is: I will now help you to combine
  1. the SOS call class and the Map class to pass its location on the Map -> "MapBox"
